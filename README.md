## Retail Orders Sales

### Project Overview:
This project focuses on analyzing the sales performance of Global Mart, a company that operates across multiple regions and offers a wide range of products with varying prices and discount structures. The main goal was to understand how the company is performing in terms of sales, discounts, shipping, and regional performance — and to help the business make smarter decisions using data.

### Project Objectives
- Understand total orders and revenue
- Measure the effect of discounts on sales
- Identify top-selling products and best-performing regions
- Analyze shipping preferences
- Find the most profitable product categories
- Support data-driven decision-making
